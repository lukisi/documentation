For help and a description of available commands, send a message to:
   <netsukuku-help@freaknet.org>
                                                                                                                             
To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <netsukuku-subscribe@freaknet.org>
                                                                                                                             
To remove your address from the list, just send a message to
the address in the ``List-Unsubscribe'' header of any list
message. If you haven't changed addresses since subscribing,
you can also send a message to:
   <netsukuku-unsubscribe@freaknet.org>
                                                                                                                             
For addition or removal of addresses, I'll send a confirmation
message to that address. When you receive it, simply reply to it
to complete the transaction.
