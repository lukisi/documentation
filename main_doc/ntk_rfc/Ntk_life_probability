Subject: Life probability 

----
This text describes a change to the Npv7.
It will be included in the final documentation, so feel free to correct it.
But if you want to change the system here described, please contact us first.

Statistically the probability of a node to continue to stay up is related to
its uptime, for example if the node X has an uptime of 30 seconds and the node Y of
1200 seconds, then it is more probable that the node Y will continue to stay
up.

For this reason we give higher credits to older nodes/gnodes, this means that
we prefer to avoid routes which contain very young nodes.

{{{
		A
	       / \
	      L   K
	       \ /
                N
}}}

Let's say K has an uptime of 600 seconds and L of 200.
The node N, to reach A, will prefer the node K.

=== Implementation ===

In the TP we record the uptime of each traversed node. In this way, the node
receiving the TP will be able to discriminate young routes from stable ones.
