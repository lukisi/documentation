  0.  Preface

  This text is the index of the Netsukuku documentation.

  The main papers describing the protocol and the algorithms are in pdf
  format, the rest are text files.

  The Netsukuku website is:
  
  http://netsukuku.freaknet.org


  1.  Netsukuku
 
  Netsukuku general document:

  http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/doc/main_doc/netsukuku.pdf

  Netsukuku is a P2P network system designed to handle a large number of nodes
  with minimal CPU and memory resources. It can be easily used to build a
  worldwide distributed, anonymous and not controlled network, separated from
  the Internet, without the support of any servers, ISPs or authority
  controls.
  In this document, we give a generic and non technical description of the
  Netsukuku network, emphasizing its main ideas and features.

  
  2.  The Netsukuku protocol

  The following are technical documents describing, in details, the design and
  the mechanisms of Netsukuku.
  They are a must for anyone who wants to understand how Netsukuku works.


  2.1  QSPN  - Quantum Shortest Path Netsukuku

  The QSPN algorithm:

  http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/doc/main_doc/qspn.pdf

  This document describes the QSPN, the routing discovery algorithm used
  by Netsukuku.
  Through a deductive analysis the main proprieties of the QSPN are
  shown. Moreover, a second version of the algorithm, is presented.


  2.2  Netsukuku topology

  Network topology document:

  http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/doc/main_doc/topology.pdf

  In this document, we describe the fractal structure of the Netsukuku
  topology. Moreover, we show how it is possible to use the QSPN v2 on
  the high levels of the fractal.


  2.3  ANDNA - Abnormal Netsukuku Domain Name Anarchy

  The Domain Name system of Netsukuku:
		
  http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/doc/main_doc/andna.pdf

  In this document, we present the Abnormal Netsukuku Domain Name
  Anarchy system. ANDNA is the distributed, non hierarchical and
  decentralised system of hostname management used in the Netsukuku
  network.

  
  2.4  Internet and Netsukuku

  Issues regarding the Netsukuku compatibility with the Internet:

  http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/doc/main_doc/inetntk.pdf

  Netsukuku is completely independent from the Internet. However, a good
  level of integration between the two networks must be preserved.
  In this document, we present the techniques that allow Netsukuku to be
  compatible with the standard Internet. Moreover, we show how it is
  possible to use virtual Internet tunnels to temporarily replace missing
  physical links.

  
  
  3.   Netsukuku RFCs

  The Netsukuku RFCs (NTK_RFC) are work in progress documents that expands,
  improve or corrects the Netsukuku protocol.

  You can find their up to date version in the Netsukuku wiki:

  http://lab.dyne.org/Netsukuku_RFC

  Their static version can be found here:

  and here:
