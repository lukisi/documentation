NAME
    ANDNA - Abnormal Netsukuku Domain Name Anarchy

DESCRIPTION
    ANDNA is the distributed, non hierarchical and decentralised system of
    hostname management in Netsukuku. It substitutes the DNS. The ANDNA
    database is scattered inside all the Netsukuku net and in the worst case
    every node will have to use about some hundreds Kb of memory.

    In order to join ANDNA it is necessary to be hooked at Netsukuku with
    the ntkd(8) daemon.

    For more information about ANDNA visit: <http://netsukuku.freaknet.org>

USAGE
    First of all be sure to have the ntkd(8) daemon up and running.

  HOSTNAME REGISTRATION
    You can register up to 256 hostnames. Each hostname can be a string of
    maximum 512 bytes, which contains a newline (\n) only at its end.

    The hostnames to be registered must be listed, one per line, in the
    andna_hostnames file, which is by default in
    /etc/netsukuku/andna_hostnames.

    The ntkd(8) daemon reads it when it is started and when it receives the
    SIGHUP signal. So if you've added a hostname while ntkd was running,
    just do:

            killall -HUP ntkd

    All the hostnames, which are already registered by other nodes, are
    added in the queue, in this way, when the other nodes won't update them,
    your hostnames will automatically be the first in the queue.

    An hostname expires after 3 days, if it isn't updated. ntkd
    automatically updates the registered hostnames, therefore your hostnames
    will expire only if you aren't present in the Netsukuku for 3 entire
    days.

    If you want to know the result of a registration read the ntkd logs.

  HOSTNAME RESOLUTION
    The ntkd(8) daemon runs also a DNS wrapper which receives standard DNS
    queries for hostnames resolution. The hostnames are resolved in ANDNA,
    then the DNS wrapper will reply to the requester.

    When the ntkd(8) daemon is started it copies /etc/resolv.conf in
    /etc/resolv.conf.bak and adds in the first line of /etc/resolv.conf the
    "nameserver 127.0.0.1" string. When it is closed it moves back
    /etc/resolv.conf.bak to /etc/resolv.conf. Use the -R option if you want
    to disable this behaviour.

    All the resolved hostnames are kept, until their expiration date, in the
    "resolved hostnames cache". The entire cache is flushed each time the
    ntkd(8) daemon receives the SIGALRM signal.

    That's all.

  IP RESOLUTION
    It is possible to know the list of hostnames registered by a node. You
    have to simply reverse resolve its ip. For example:

            dig -x 127.0.0.2

    This command shows your currently registered hostnames. You can use it
    to know what hostnames have been already registered. Note the 127.0.0.2
    ip. If you use 127.0.0.1 you get only the local hostname written in
    /etc/hosts.

  SCATTERED NAME SERVICE DISGREGATION
    The Scattered Name Service Disgregation is the ANDNA equivalent of the
    SRV Record of the Internet Domain Name System. For a complete
    description of the SNSD read the NTK_RFC 0009:
    <http://lab.dyne.org/Ntk_SNSD>

   SNSD NODE REGISTRATION
     * Modify the /etc/netsukuku/snsd_nodes file.
     * Copy the needed public keys
     * Send a SIGHUP to the NetsukukuD of the register node:

   SNSD NODE DELETION
    Not implemented

   SNSD HNAME RESOLUTION
    The utility ntk-resolv(8) can be used to resolve SNSD hostnames.
    Examples:

            ntk-resolv -s 53/udp host
            ntk-resolv -s http host

SIGNALS
    When the SIGHUP signal is sent to ntkd(8), the andna_hostnames and
    snsd_nodes files will be reloaded and it will try to register all the
    new added hostnames and snsd records.

    When the SIGALRM signal is sent to ntkd(8), the resolved hostnames cache
    will be flushed.

FILES
    /etc/netsukuku/andna_hostnames
        It is the file where the hostnames to be registerd in ANDNA are kept
        one per line. It's location can be changed by modifying its option
        in the netsukuku.conf file.

    /etc/netsukuku/snsd_nodes
        The snsd_nodes file keeps the list of the SNSD records which will be
        register in ANDNA.

    /usr/share/netsukuku/andna_lcl_keyring
        In this keyring your ANDNA public and secret keys are saved. Handle
        this file with care: without it, you won't be able to update your
        hostnames, thus you'll definitely lose them.

    /usr/share/netsukuku/andna_cache
    /usr/share/netsukuku/andna_lcl_cache
    /usr/share/netsukuku/andna_rh_cache
    /usr/share/netsukuku/andna_counter_cache
        They are the saved ANDNA caches. Their locations can be changed in
        netsukuku.conf.
