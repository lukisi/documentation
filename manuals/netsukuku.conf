NAME
    netsukuku.conf - Netsukuku daemon configuration file

SYNOPSIS
    /etc/netsukuku/netsukuku.conf

DESCRIPTION
    ntkd loads its options from the command line and from netsukuku.conf.
    The options that are changed infrequently resides in the configuration
    file. The netsukuku.conf file is typically installed at
    /etc/netsukuku/netsukuku.conf.

    The comments starts with a '#'. If an option is commented, ntkd will use
    its default value.

    The character '=' is used to assign a value to an option.

    All the options will be overridden by their command line equivalent.

OPTIONS
  RESTRICTED MODE
    ntk_restricted_mode = *bool*
        When set to 1, NetsukukuD will be started in restricted mode to be
        compatible with Internet. In the restricted mode, only IPs of the
        largest private subnet, i.e. 10.x.x.x are chosen.

        Default: 0

    ntk_restricted_class = *bool*
        When set to 1 the IPs will be chosen from the
        172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 range (use this option only if you can't
        use the 10.x.x.x class).

        Default: 0

  INTERNET CONNECTION
    All these Internet options requires ntk_restricted_mode set to 1.

    internet_connection = *bool*
        When set to 1, it specifies that this computer has an active
        Internet connection. Note that ntkd will overwrite any default route
        if this option is set to 0 and the shared Internet connections of
        other nodes are used.

        Default: 0

    internet_gateway = *IP:interface*
        It specifies the default gateway used by *localhost* to reach the
        Internet. This option is necessary only if you don't have the
        default route set when you run NetsukukuD (i.e. you haven't
        connected yet). If this option isn't specified, ntkd will
        automatically retrieve the default Internet gateway from the routing
        table. Example: internet_gateway = 192.168.1.1:eth0

        Default: (null)

    internet_download_rate = *Kb*
        This option is required if the internet_connection option has been
        set to 1. It must be set to the download rate of the Internet
        connection in KiloBytes. Example:

                internet_download_rate = 640

        Default: (null)

    internet_upload_rate = *Kb*
        This option is required if the internet_connection option has been
        set to 1. It must be set to the upload rate of the Internet
        connection in KiloBytes. Example:

                internet_upload_rate = 30

        Default: (null)

    internet_ping_hosts = *host1:host2:host3:...*
        Specifies a list of Internet hostnames which ntkd will ping
        periodically to verify the status of the Internet connection. If all
        the hosts specified aren't reachable, it will assume that the
        Internet connection isn't available anymore. When one them becoms
        pingable, ntkd will enable again the Internet Gateway Search.
        Example:

                internet_ping_hosts = google.com:cisco.com:sourceforge.net:dyne.org

        This option hasn't a default value, it must be specified in the
        netsukuku.conf file.

    share_internet = *bool*
        When set to 1, ntkd shares the Internet connection among all the
        other Netsukuku nodes.

        Default: 1

    shape_internet = *bool*
        Specifies if ntkd will execute the /etc/netsukuku/tc_shaper.sh
        script to activate the traffic shaping of the Internet connection.

        Default: 0

    use_shared_internet = *bool*
        Specifies if ntkd will load balance the Internet traffic of this
        host using the Inet connections shared by the Netsukuku nodes. When
        set to 0, localhost (this machine) uses only its local Internet
        connection (if any).

        Default: 1

    # ### ANDNA #

     To disable the start of the ANDNA daemon at the launch of ntkd, set
     this option to 1. Note that when the ANDNA daemon is disabled, the andna
     system will not work at all, so it will be impossible to resolve, register
     or update hostnames.

    disable_andna = 0

     When NetsukukuD starts it modifies /etc/resolv.conf writing in the first
     line "nameserver 127.0.0.1". The old /etc/resolv.conf is copied in
     /etc/resolv.conf.bak. When the daemon is closed /etc/resolv.conf is
     restored. If you want to disable this set disable_resolvconf to 1.
     If it is disabled you won't be able to resolve hostnames!

    disable_resolvconf = 0

    # ### Limits #

     How many connection the netsukuku daemons can simultaneusly handle.

    ntk_max_connections = 512

     How many simultaneusly connections to the daemons from a single host are
     allowed.
    ntk_max_accepts_per_host        = 16

     The wait time necessary for a host to reconnect to the daemons after all the
     ntk_max_accepts_per_host were used.

    max_accepts_per_host_time = 4 #in seconds
