NAME
    ntkdig - Andns Lookup Resolver

SYNOPSIS
    ntkdig [-vnPtrsSh] host

DESCRIPTION
    Ntkdig is an interface to ANDNA daemon: it performs andns queries and
    displays the answers to stdout. It is able to formule questions for
    objects in Internet and Netsukuku realms. It uses the 'andns protocol'
    to encode his contents, as explained in Netsukuku RFC 006.

USAGE
    The simplest example is:

            ntkdig hname

    With this comand, it asks ANDNA to tell which IP registerd the hostname
    'hname'. The default behavior is to perform the query in the Netsukuku
    realm.

OPTIONS
    -v --version
        Print Version, then exit.

    -n --nameserver=host
        Specify the nameserver to use. The default is localhost.

    -P --port=n
        Uses the port <n> of nameserver. Default is 53.

    -t --type=snsd --type=ptr
        Specify the query type . Default is snsd.

    -r --realm=inet --realm=ntk
        Specify the realm of the query: Internet or Netsukuku. Default is
        ntk.

    -s --service=n[/proto]
        Specify the SNSD service and the relative protocol to search. See
        services(5). The service can be specified in alfanumeric or numeric
        format. The default service and protocol are 0 and tcp. Example:

                ntk-dig -s domain/udp host
                ntk-dig -s 53/udp host

        See the section QUERY TYPE, SERVICES AND PROTOCOL for a better
        explanation.

    -S --silent
        With this option, ntkdig will be very discrete.

    -h --help
        Prints to stdout a short explanation of ntkdig.

    Options that take arguments could be expressed in a shorter way, by
    specifing univoque abbreviation of argument. So, there is the
    equivalence:

    ntkdig -r i = ntkdig -r inet

QUERY TYPE, SERVICES AND PROTOCOL
    SNSD Query Type are hostname resolutions. With SNSD (Scattered Name
    Service Disgregation) ANDNA lets the user to ask for a domain and a
    service. If service is 0, the resolution will show which IP registered
    the hostname. If service is non-0, the resolution will show which IP
    gives specified service for the hostname (considering the protocol too).
    See services(5).

    You can specify a service as expressed in /etc/services. It can be
    expressed also in numeric form. It is also possible to specify the
    protocol:

            "domain", "53", "53/udp", "domain/udp"

    are valid service/proto strings.

    For example, the next commands will retrieve the IP(s) that offers
    web-pages for the hostname "host":

            ntk-dig -s http/tcp host
            ntk-dig -s 80/tcp   host
            ntk-dig -s 80       host
            ntk-dig -s http     host

    To configure the SNSD delegations, see the SNSD HowTo.

    If the delegation for a service (say http) is not set, the IP returned
    is the IP that registered the hostname. So, if you do not want to set
    SNSD delegations for specific services, the main hostname IP will be
    used and you don't need to do nothing.

    The hope is that every client will build different queries: browsers
    will make queries with service=80 and proto=tcp, mail-clients will build
    queries with service=25 and proto tcp and so on.

    The service is useless if the query realm is Internet.

    The default service is 0: ie, the query will return the IP that
    registered the hostname. Default protocol is tcp. Protocol is ignored
    when service requested is 0.

    Note: service and proto are also ignored when the query type is
    `ip->host` (ptr query type).
