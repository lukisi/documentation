NAME
    ntkdig - Andns Lookup Resolver

SYNOPSIS
    ntkdig [-vnPtrspSh] host

DESCRIPTION
    Ntkdig is an interface to ANDNA daemon: it performs andns queries and
    displays the answers to stdout. It is able to formule questions for
    objects in Internet and Netsukuku realms. It uses the 'andns protocol'
    to encode his contents, as explained in Netsukuku RFC 006.

USAGE
    The simplest example is:

            ntkdig hname

    With this comand, it asks ANDNA to tell which IP registerd the hostname
    'hname'. The default behavior is to perform the query in the Netsukuku
    realm.

OPTIONS
    -v --version
        Print Version, then exit.

    -n --nameserver=host
        Specify the nameserver to use. The default is localhost.

    -P --port=n
        Uses the port <n> of nameserver. Default is 53.

    -t --type=snsd --type=ptr
        Specify the query type . Default is snsd.

    -r --realm=inet --realm=ntk
        Specify the realm of the query: Internet or Netsukuku. Default is
        ntk.

    -s --service=n
        Specify the SNSD service to search. See /etc/services, Default is 0.

    -p --protocol=tcp --protocol=udp
        Specify protocol for SNSD service. Default is tcp.

    -S --silent
        With this option, ntkdig will be very discrete.

    -h --help
        Prints to stdout a short explanation of ntkdig.

    Options that take arguments could be expressed in a shorter way, by
    specifing univoque abbreviation of argument. So, there is the
    equivalence:

    ntkdig -r i = ntkdig -r inet

QUERY TYPE, SERVICES AND PROTOCOL
    SNSD Query Type are hostname resolutions. If service is 0, the
    resolution will show which IP registered the hostname. If service is
    non-0, the resolution will show which IP gives specified service for the
    hostname (considering the protocol too). See /etc/services.

    For example, asking for "depausceve" with service 80 and proto tcp, will
    retrieve the IP that publishes HTTP pages for hostname "depausceve". The
    hope is that every client will build different queries: browsers will
    make queries with service=80 and proto=tcp, mail-clients will build
    queries with service=25 and proto tcp and so on.
