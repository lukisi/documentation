== Netsukuku can create a global Net indipendent from the Internet ==

{{{ 
The Open Source enables you to migrate towards free software, but there is
no chance to join your PC to the rest of the world in a free way.  
Imagine to be titular of full membership into a global Network, without signing 
contracts with any Internet Operators. Imagine to surf in a Net where there is 
no central regulating Authority which assigns IP, conditions, names and
suffixes...
Netsukuku, an Open Source software, which can be downloaded from
http://netsukuku.freaknet.org, makes possible the creation of a new distributed
global Net, expandable to an unlimited number of users, independent and
totally apart from the Internet.  Due to the Netsukuku particular routing
system, created by the "Freaknet" group of Catania (Italy), the Net is self
sustained, thanks to all the Net users, which share a small part of their
own PC resources.  Anybody has the chance to join the Net and, at the same
time, to let other users do the same.  
In this way, the countries and areas of the globe where Internet
facilities are still not available, simply through a wi-fi 
coverage, can create and develop a Net without submitting themselves 
to any Internet Operators or to any regulating central Authorities.

"I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one...."
