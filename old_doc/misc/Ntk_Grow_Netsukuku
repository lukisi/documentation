== Grow Netsukuku ==

Netsukuku is a mesh network.
The mesh networks depend on the collaboration of each node, in fact, a
distributed network can grow only with the small contributions of each user.

Don't expect that someone will set up the whole net for you, just
because Netsukuku is decentralised, anonymous, distributed and independent
and it will never be possible to anybody to control it.

You have the possibility to be the citizen of a free world wide community,
where no one will ever be able to limit your digital rights with measures like
prosecution of file sharing, censorship, data retention, commercial
connectivity and so on.

=== Joining Netsukuku ===

The first step is to turn your PC into a Netsukuku node:
        * take a computer
        * install any distro of GNU/Linux
        * install Netsukuku
        * buy a wifi (PCI) card
        * buy/build an external antenna (with the longest range as possible)
or
	* buy an Access Point compatible with the Netsukuku-AP firmware
        * buy/build an external antenna (with the longest range as possible)
	* connect the AP to your PC. In this case it doesn't matter anymore 
	  what OS you've installed and even if your PC is turned off, the AP 
	  will continue to be an active Netsukuku node..

It's highly probable you will be the first node in your neighborhood,
but this is normal: someone have to be the first.
As soon as another user will do the same thing you did, you will be
automatically connected to each other.
Waiting doesn't cost you nothing.

In order to shorten your waiting you can help the growth of Netsukuku in your
neighborhood by following the advises written below.

=== Internet sharing ===

If you have an Internet connection, share it with your neighbours.
In this way everybody will be able to have a free Internet connection without
worrying of his or her location. Moreover, when this habit will be common, you
won't worry too, anywhere and anytime.

Don't worry too much about sharing your bandwidth.
These are some features of sharing the Internet connection with Netsukuku:
 * You can connect to the Internet using, at the same time, multiple node
   which share their connection. For example, if there are 5 nodes sharing
   their 640Kb/s connections, you can have 5 parallel downloads at 640Kb/s.
 * If you decide to share your Internet connection, you will always use the
   Internet connections shared by the other nodes. In this way, you donate
   your bandwidth, but, at the same time, receive donations from other users.
 * Even if you share your Internet connection to other Netsukuku nodes, your
   traffic will have the maximum priority, therefore you won't notice any
   slowdown.

=== Spread the word ===

It is very important to let your neighbours aware of being inside a
Netsukuku area.
You have just to mark in a visible way the area, for example using:
 * stickers: /* TODO: image and phrase for the sticker URL */
 * papers: /* TODO: url of the sheet to print */
 * posters: /* TODO */

=== City-City link ===

In the same way two nodes close to each other are linked, it is possible to connect 
two close cities by wireless links.
Otherwise, if it is impossible to link physically them (f.e. there is a desert
area between them), they can still be connected with the use of Internet tunnels.

=== Documentation ===

Another useful thing you can do is writing or translating documentation.
Use the wiki: http://lab.dyne.org/Netsukuku

=== Code ===

There is a lot to code too! If you are a Kung Foo coder, get on board and
help the development writing some nice poems. For a start you can take a look
at the src/TODO file.

=== Misc ===

Finally, every good work you can do is welcomed and it will surely be used,
for example if you like to draw upload your drawings.
